Energy Consumption Forecasting (Time-Series + Anomaly Detection) – Simple Explanation
1. Energy Consumption Forecasting:
    Predicting how much energy (electricity, gas, etc.) 
    will be used in the future based on past usage data.
2. Anomaly Detection:
    Finding unusual patterns or 
    spikes in energy use that don’t fit the normal trend.
3. Together:
     building a system that can predict future 
    energy usage and alert if something unusual happens.

“It’s a system that predicts how much energy will be used and flags unusual consumption patterns automatically.”
